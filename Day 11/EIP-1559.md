Gas in Ethereum : 

- Gas = uint to measure computation 
- Nodes runs the blockchain and get paid in Eth to process transactions 
- More complex transactions need more gas 
- Each low-level instruction (opcodes) costs a certain amount of gas 
```
Transaction fee formula: 
Transaction fee = Gas price x Gas used 
```


Gas Price Breakdowm (EIP- 1559):

1. Base Fee 
    - Minimum gas fee for a transaction 
    - Measured in Gwei (1 Eth = 1,000,000,000 Gwei)
    - Changes based on network congestion 
        - if blocks is >50% full -> fee increase 
        - if blocks is <50% full -> fee decreases 
    - Burned (removed from circulation)

2. Max Fee
    - the max gas price you're willing to pay 

3. Max Priority Fee
    - A tip for miners/validators to priorities your transaction 



Ethereum Storage basics: 

- Storage Variables (State variables)
    - Stored permanently on the blockchain 
    - Stored in 32-bytes slots (like a giant list)
    - e.g:
