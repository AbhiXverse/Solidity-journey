Contract Ownership & Security :- 

- Assign a contract owner : 
    - Use a **constructor**, which runs only when the contract is deployed 
    - E.g : 
```
    contract Ownable {
    address public owner ;
 
    constructor () {
        owner = msg.sender; // Assigns contract deployer as the                                  owner 
        }
     }
```

Modifiers (Adding extra logic to functions):-

- Modifiers let you add reusable checks to functions 
- E.g : 
```
  modifier onlyowner( ) {
      require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
      _;
     }

	  function withdraw() public onlyowner {
	     payable(owner). transfer(address(this).balance); 
	     }
   }
```
- here, only the contract owner can withdraw the Eth.

Constant & Immutable Variables 
- Constant:- Cannot be changed, written in All Caps
- Immutable :- Can be set once (e.g, in the constructor)
- E.g: 
```
  contract Example {
     uint256 public constant FEE - 1000;  // Never changes
     address public immutable i_owner;
     
  constructor() {
      i_owner - msg.sender;   // set only once 
      
  }  
}
```
