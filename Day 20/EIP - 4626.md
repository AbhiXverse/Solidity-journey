- EIP- 4626 is a standard for tokenized vaults 
- it defines a common interface(set of rules) for Defi vaults that accept token (like DAI, USDT) and give out shares in return
- it helps make vaults interoperable with other protocols and DApps



**What is Vault ?**

- A vault is a smart contract where you can deposit tokens and earn yield (returns)
- when you deposit, the vault gives you shares which represents your ownership in the vault 
- you can withdraw your tokens later by returning those shares 



**Why EIP- 4626 was needed ?**

- Before EIP-4626, each vault had its own way of working, which made integration hard 
- After EIP- 4626, creates a unified structure to make a vaults easier to use, build, and integrate 



**Example** - 

- You deposit 100 DAI into a vault 
- Vault gives you 10 shares (share price = 10 DAI)
- later vault grows (due to yield), share price = 12 DAI 
- you redeem 10 shares = you get back 120 DAI -> you made a profit
