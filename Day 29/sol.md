**Literals**: 

- Literals types refers to fixed values in solidity (like numbers )
- e.g -
    - uint256 = 5  (a literal value for a uint type)
    - "Abhi" (a string literal)


**Conversion Rules:** 

- Implicit conversion - 
    - solidity automatically converts between compatible types (e.g - smaller integer to larger integer)

- Explicit conversion - 
    -  we need to manually convert between types, this is also called as type casting (e.g - uint8(5))
        - converting between uint types (uint256 to uint8)
        - Address to byte conversion and vice versa
