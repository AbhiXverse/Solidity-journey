What is Uniswap ? 

- Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain 
- It operates without trusted intermediaries (no centralized order book), ensuring decentralized, censorship resistance and security.


Core Concepts:

- Automated Market Maker (AMM) - 
    - Uniswap uses an AMM model instead of traditional order book for matching buyers and sellers

- Liquidity Pools:
    - A liquidity pool is a reserve of two ERC-20 tokens, managed by a Uniswap smart contract used for token swaps 



Constant Product Formula: 

- Uniswap's liquidity pools follow the Constant Product Formula - ```
```
X * Y = K
```
