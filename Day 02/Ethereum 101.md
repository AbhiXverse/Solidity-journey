Cryptography in Ethereum 

- Two types of cryptography: 
    - Symmetric cryptography: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption 
    - Asymmetric cryptography(Public-key cryptography): Uses two keys, a public key and a private key
- Ethereum uses asymmetric cryptography for digital signatures 
  (not for encryption)
- Digital Signature Algorithm used: ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): A method of public-key cryptography using mathematical propert
