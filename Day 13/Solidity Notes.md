ABI (Application binary interface) Encoding/decoding 

- What is ABI ? 
    -  this is a standard where you can interact between smart contracts and external actors (e.g - other contracts, applications)

- Encoding/ Decoding: 
    - Encoding - Converts data (like number, adresses etc) into a format suitable for EVM 
    - Decoding - converts raw transaction data back  into human readable format 

- Tools: 
    - web3.js, ether.js and solidity libraries help interact with ABI 


Data Location 

- Storage:
    - Persistent state - variables stored here cost gas to modify 
    - data is kept on-chain 
    - e.g - state variables inside contracts 

- Memory:
     - Temporary
