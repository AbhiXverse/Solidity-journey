Ethereum is "A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application"

Purpose:

- Ethereum is more than just a currency or payment network.
- It has a native currency called Ether (Eth).
- Ether is needed to run a part of ethereum platform.
- It acts as a utility token for using the ethereum platform.

Programming language:

- Bitcoin uses a simple scripting language called Script.
- This language is limited and only checks if a transaction is true or false.
- In Ethereum, it supports EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).
- EVM is designed to be a general-purpose computing platform. 
- It is Turing complete, meaning it can handle any logic or computation. 

What Ethereum can do?

- Can store any type of data, from simple numbers and text to complex structure like lists and mappings. 
- Can execute any kind of logic, form the basic math to advanced algorithms.
- More flexible than Bitcoin's script because it is not limited in complexity.

How they track transactions ?

1. Bitcoin tracks transactions using a system called UTXO( Unspent Transaction Outputs)
    -  It only records the ownership of bitcoin and how it moves between users.

2. Ethereum uses an account-based system instead of UTXO. 
    - It tracks not only the Ether ownership but also the state of smart contract.
    - Transaction can change the state of contracts and interact with decentralized applications (Dapps).
